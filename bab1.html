            <p>The Integrated Learning Project (ILP) for ninth graders is a comprehensive program designed to combine multiple subjects into a real-world application. This year, we were tasked with organizing a bazaar and a performing arts show, which required extensive planning, collaboration, and creativity. <span class="highlight">The project was officially started in July 2024</span>, with each class being divided into small groups of 6-7 members, who were expected to work together until the final evaluation in April 2025. <span class="highlight">Our team, named AstanaKarya, was formed with the vision of showcasing Indonesia’s cultural heritage through our booth and products. The name "Astana" was chosen as it means "palace" in Sanskrit</span>, symbolizing grandeur, while "Karya" was used to represent the creative works we aimed to present. <span class="highlight">Our logo, theme, and products were carefully selected to align with the overarching goal of promoting Indonesia’s diverse culture.</span></p>

              <p>Throughout our planning, <span class="highlight">various product ideas were explored before the final selection was made</span>. Initially, <span class="highlight">biotechnology-based milk buns using instant yeast were considered</span>, but due to budget constraints, an alternative was chosen—recycled paper, which aligns with sustainability principles. Additionally, <span class="highlight">handcrafted batik hair bows were created</span>, and custom-made stickers, pouches featuring Indonesian landmarks, and keychains inspired by local flora were produced. <span class="highlight">Food and beverage items such as waffles with different toppings and "Dieng Frizz," a mojito-inspired drink, were also introduced</span>. To attract visitors, <span class="highlight">a booth based on Indonesia’s traditional market carts was meticulously designed</span>. While initial plans included a stall-style setup, material limitations resulted in a simpler design, yet cultural elements such as traditional puppets and wooden wheels were maintained. <span class="highlight">An Instagram page was set up to showcase our products, and pre-orders were made available for customers.</span></p>

            <p>Aside from the bazaar, <span class="highlight">participation in a performing arts show was required</span>. Our team collaborated with another group, Yogi’s Treasure, to produce a musical drama that combined acting with live music. <span class="highlight">The performance was carefully planned to convey messages of friendship and cultural appreciation while incorporating elements of Indonesia’s traditions</span>. Despite initial script and choreography challenges, <span class="highlight">a well-received final performance was delivered</span>. The ILP was not just an academic exercise but a valuable learning experience where essential life skills were acquired. Insights into entrepreneurship, event management, teamwork, and adaptability were gained. Communication was recognized as a crucial factor in ensuring smooth collaboration, while problem-solving skills were developed to overcome challenges. Through hard work and perseverance, the complexities of the project were successfully navigated, and goals were ultimately achieved.</p>
